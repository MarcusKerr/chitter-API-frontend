Twitter clone, connecting to API backend

## Brief

### Chitter API Frontend Challenge

The scenario is similar to the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge), except someone has already built a backend API for you and hosted it on Heroku.

Your task is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API. You can do this in any framework you like, or in pure Javascript. [The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

Here are some interactions the API supports. Implement as many as you see fit.

* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps
* Viewing all Peeps *(I suggest you start here)*
* Viewing individual Peeps
* Deleting Peeps
* Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps

We are looking for well tested, easy to read, easy to change code. This is more important than the number of interactions you implement.

Note that others may be doing the same task at the same time, so the data may change as you are using it.

### Utilities you might find useful

* [The Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for making requests.
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for exploring the API.
